The motivation behind what this program does is based on sharing common motifs in two different DNA strings. Overlapping graph, is a term, comes from the directed graph theory. If two DNA strings share the same motif like one's tail matches with the other's top, there exist a directed relationship which is represented by an arrow. Finding two strings which satisfy to share a motif is what this program does.
